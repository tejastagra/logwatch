# LogWatch 🔐  
> A lightweight Python tool to detect brute-force attacks by analyzing authentication logs.

LogWatch is a simple yet powerful Python script that scans system authentication logs for repeated failed login attempts. It flags IP addresses that exceed a defined threshold and generates a CSV report for further investigation or banning.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Log Parsing** – Scans system auth logs (e.g. `/var/log/system.log` on macOS)
- 🚨 **Attack Detection** – Detects IPs with excessive failed login attempts
- 📊 **CSV Reports** – Outputs suspicious IPs and attempt counts to `report.csv`
- ⚙️ **Configurable** – Easy to change thresholds and log file path
- 📁 **Testable** – Comes with a sample log file for demo/testing

---

## 👥 Sample Output

```bash
🔍 Analyzing log file: sample_logs/sample_auth.log

🚨 Suspicious IPs:
192.168.1.100 → 5 failed attempts

📁 Report saved to report.csv
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/logwatch.git
cd logwatch
```

### 2. Set Up Environment *(Optional but Recommended)*
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Run the Analyzer
```bash
python3 main.py
```

> If using a real system log (like `/var/log/system.log`), run with `sudo`:
```bash
sudo python3 main.py
```

---

## 🧪 Testing with Sample Logs

To test without accessing real system logs, the project includes a sample log:
```python
# logwatch/config.py
LOG_PATH = "sample_logs/sample_auth.log"
```

Edit this file to point to `sample_logs/sample_auth.log` to simulate detection.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Adjust the detection sensitivity in `logwatch/config.py`:
```python
LOG_PATH = "/var/log/system.log"  # or your custom test file
ATTEMPT_THRESHOLD = 5            # Number of failures before flagging an IP
```

---

## 📋 Requirements

Python 3.6 or above. No external libraries required.

Install dependencies (if you add optional ones like `matplotlib` or `ipinfo`):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📄 Example Report (`report.csv`)

```
IP Address,Attempts
192.168.1.100,5
203.0.113.5,8
```
